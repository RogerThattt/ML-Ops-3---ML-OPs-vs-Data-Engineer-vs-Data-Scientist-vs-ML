Role	                Water System Parallelism	                                          Real-World Practice
Data Engineer	        Use high-capacity pipes to move water across many tanks	            Use Spark, dbt, Airflow DAGs, etc. — declarative orchestration over big data
Data Scientist	      Use smart filters and branching pipes to process in parallel	      Use Pandas, Polars, Dask, SQL — avoid for loops, use vectorized ops
ML Engineer	          Use multiple pumps to train models across tanks in parallel	        Use TensorFlow graphs, PyTorch DDP, or Accelerate to parallelize training
MLOps Engineer	      Build an automated control system for pumps and flow routing	      Use MLflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, Vertex AI, or SageMaker Pipelines to declaratively  define and orchestrate training, tuning, deployment, monitoring
