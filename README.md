<p>Role Water System Parallelism Real-World Practice Data Engineer Use high-capacity pipes to move water across many tanks Use Spark, dbt, Airflow DAGs, etc. &mdash; declarative orchestration over big data Data Scientist Use smart filters and branching pipes to process in parallel Use Pandas, Polars, Dask, SQL &mdash; avoid for loops, use vectorized ops ML Engineer Use multiple pumps to train models across tanks in parallel Use TensorFlow graphs, PyTorch DDP, or Accelerate to parallelize training MLOps Engineer Build an automated control system for pumps and flow routing Use MLflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, Vertex AI, or SageMaker Pipelines to declaratively define and orchestrate training, tuning, deployment, monitoring</p>
